ðŸš¢ Exploring the Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and EDA ðŸš¢

I recently had the opportunity to dive into the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, and it was quite an enlightening experience! In this assignment, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns hidden within the data.

Data Cleaning:

I began by loading the dataset and addressing missing values in columns like 'Age' and 'Embarked'. Missing ages were filled with the median age, while missing embarkation points were filled with the mode (most frequent value).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations played a key role in understanding the dataset. I plotted histograms to visualize the distribution of passenger ages, and count plots to explore the distribution of passengers by sex and passenger class.
The insights gained from these visualizations were invaluable. For instance, we could see the distribution of ages among passengers, the proportion of male vs. female passengers, and the distribution of passengers across different classes.

Relationships Between Variables:

To delve deeper, I explored relationships between variables such as survival rate by sex and passenger class. These analyses revealed interesting trends, such as differences in survival rates based on gender and passenger class.


Exploratory data analysis is crucial for understanding datasets and uncovering insights that can inform decision-making.
Visualizations are powerful tools for exploring data and communicating findings effectively.
